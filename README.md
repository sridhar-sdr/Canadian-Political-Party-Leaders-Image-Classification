# Canadian-Political-Party-Leaders-Image-Classification

The Problem statement
Our problem was classifying the faces of the leader of the political parties during the 2021 Canadian federal election.
The Dataset
The dataset contains 497 photos, which were scared from the web, with an equal distribution between the five classes. Below is an example from each of the five classes.

The possible classes for the classification model are Annamie Paul, Jagmeet Singh, Justin Trudeau, Erin Oâ€™Tool, and Yves-Francois Blanchet.
The data is split into training and testing datasets containing 431 images and 66 images, respectfully.
This is supervised learning, with the classes being labelled by the indexes in the following image.
